Say you’re a geography teacher with 35 students in your class and you want
to give a pop quiz on US state capitals. Alas, your class has a few bad eggs in
it, and you can’t trust the students not to cheat. You’d like to randomize the
order of questions so that each quiz is unique, making it impossible for anyone to crib answers from anyone else. Of course, doing this by hand would
be a lengthy and boring affair. Fortunately, you know some Python.
Here is what the program does:
•	 Creates 35 different quizzes.

•	 Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order.

•	 Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each
question, in random order.

•	 Writes the quizzes to 35 text files.

•	 Writes the answer keys to 35 text files.
